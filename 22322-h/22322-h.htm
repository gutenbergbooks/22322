Altruism: A Legend of Old Persia.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In the flowery land of Persia
</p>
<p>
Long ago, as poets tell,
</p>
<p>
Where three rivers met together
</p>
<p>
Did a happy people dwell.
</p>
<p>
Never did these happy people
</p>
<p>
Suffer sickness, plague, or dearth,
</p>
<p>
Living in a golden climate
</p>
<p>
In the fairest place on earth,
</p>
<p>
Living thus thro' endless summers
</p>
<p>
And half-summers hardly colder,
</p>
<p>
Growing, tho' they hardly guessed it,
</p>
<p>
Very gradually older.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I can very well imagine
</p>
<p>
These old Persian lords and ladies
</p>
<p>
Sitting in their pleasant gardens,
</p>
<p>
Dreaming, dozing, where the shade is;
</p>
<p>
Almond trees a mass of blossom,
</p>
<p>
Roses, roses, red as wine,
</p>
<p>
With the helmets of the tulips
</p>
<p>
Flaming in a martial line,
</p>
<p>
While beside a marble basin,
</p>
<p>
With a fountain gushing forth,
</p>
<p>
Stands a red-legged crane, alighted
</p>
<p>
From the deserts of the North.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
So they lived these ancient people,
</p>
<p>
With the happy harmless faces,
</p>
<p>
Dreaming till the purple twilight
</p>
<p>
In their flowery garden-places,
</p>
<p>
Finding every year the sunshine
</p>
<p>
And the wind a little colder,
</p>
<p>
Growing, tho' they hardly guessed it,
</p>
<p>
Very gradually older,
</p>
<p>
Till at last they grew so frail
</p>
<p>
That to their gardens they were carried,
</p>
<p>
Very feeble and exhausted,
</p>
<p>
Weak as babes&#8212;But still they tarried,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Lying till the purple twilight
</p>
<p>
Wrapped in wool but hardly warm,
</p>
<p>
Wearing shawls of costliest texture
</p>
<p>
Lest the wind might do them harm,
</p>
<p>
Feeling very faint sensations
</p>
<p>
Of delight in each old breast,
</p>
<p>
Twittering with tiny voices
</p>
<p>
Like young swallows in a nest.
</p>
<p>
Then the young men spoke together
</p>
<p>
As they feasted in the taverns,
</p>
<p>
&#34;It is time to take our Fathers,
</p>
<p>
We must bear them to the Caverns.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In a mountain were the Caverns,
</p>
<p>
Fourteen leagues across the sand,
</p>
<p>
Fourteen leagues across the desert
</p>
<p>
In a naked golden land.
</p>
<p>
Black and bold and bare the mountain
</p>
<p>
Modelled into many shapes,
</p>
<p>
Cones and pyramids and pillars,
</p>
<p>
Beetling cliffs and jutting capes.
</p>
<p>
And within it were the Caverns
</p>
<p>
Tunnelled into every part,
</p>
<p>
Some by ancient Persian devils,
</p>
<p>
Others by a modern art.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Where the terraced lawns lay dreaming,
</p>
<p>
Underneath a cedar-tree
</p>
<p>
Dozed an ancient, ancient person
</p>
<p>
Tiny as a child of three.
</p>
<p>
Every day a gobbling negro
</p>
<p>
To his place the old man carried;
</p>
<p>
Very feeble and exhausted
</p>
<p>
Did he seem&#8212;but still he tarried.
</p>
<p>
Then Hasan, the young lord, murmured,
</p>
<p>
As he feasted in the taverns,
</p>
<p>
&#34;It is time to take my Father,
</p>
<p>
I must bear him to the Caverns.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
So he took his long-maned pony,
</p>
<p>
Her who wore the silver shoes,
</p>
<p>
Galloped thro' the crowded highways
</p>
<p>
Like one with no time to lose.
</p>
<p>
Purpose in his warning outcry
</p>
<p>
(Was he not the next of kin?)
</p>
<p>
Till he reached his palace gateway,
</p>
<p>
Flung the rein and fled within,
</p>
<p>
Chose with care a wicker basket
</p>
<p>
Very strong and deep and wide,
</p>
<p>
Laying shawls of costliest texture
</p>
<p>
And an eider quilt inside.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Underneath the spreading cedar,
</p>
<p>
In an arbour newly built,
</p>
<p>
Found Hasan his ancient person,
</p>
<p>
Put him underneath the quilt,
</p>
<p>
Mounted then his long-maned pony
</p>
<p>
With the basket on his arm,
</p>
<p>
Carrying it very firmly
</p>
<p>
Lest his father might take harm.
</p>
<p>
Galloped thro' the crowded highway,
</p>
<p>
Passing by the Street of Taverns,
</p>
<p>
Fourteen leagues across the desert
</p>
<p>
Till he came unto the Caverns.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Fastened then his long-maned pony
</p>
<p>
To a ring-post at the mouth
</p>
<p>
(Scores and scores of ring-posts were there
</p>
<p>
Where the Caverns faced the South)
</p>
<p>
Plunged within the long wide gallery
</p>
<p>
Tunnelled 'neath the rocky roof,
</p>
<p>
With a lantern light exploring
</p>
<p>
All the dark which lay aloof,
</p>
<p>
Treading swiftly, treading surely,
</p>
<p>
With the basket on his arm,
</p>
<p>
Carrying it very firmly
</p>
<p>
Lest his father might take harm.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Till he came a byway unto
</p>
<p>
Fashioned from another way,
</p>
<p>
And a niche seen at the summit
</p>
<p>
Of a guiding lantern ray.
</p>
<p>
Lifted then the basket gently,
</p>
<p>
Poised, and placed it in the niche,
</p>
<p>
Saying &#34;Farewell, ancient father,
</p>
<p>
'Tis the custom&#34; ... after which
</p>
<p>
Bowed his head before his father
</p>
<p>
Thrice, and swiftly turned to go,
</p>
<p>
Knowing that it was the custom,
</p>
<p>
Thinking it was better so.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Suddenly he heard a droning,
</p>
<p>
Like a gnat's small plaintive lay,
</p>
<p>
Somewhere in the dark behind him
</p>
<p>
Where the &#34;Ancient Persons&#34; lay,
</p>
<p>
Heard a little ghostly twitter
</p>
<p>
Like a voice addressing him,
</p>
<p>
Turned and saw his father staring
</p>
<p>
Just above the basket rim,
</p>
<p>
Staring at Hasan, his strong son,
</p>
<p>
With his filmy red-rimmed eyes,
</p>
<p>
&#34;What's ado, Oh! ancient father?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Cried Hasan in great surprise.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Son,&#34; replied the ancient person,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Tho' a miser is disgraced,
</p>
<p>
Even in a wealthy household
</p>
<p>
Monstrous is the crime of waste,
</p>
<p>
Strong and shapely is the basket
</p>
<p>
Much hath held and more will take;
</p>
<p>
If you leave it in the Caverns
</p>
<p>
Won't it be a great mistake?
</p>
<p>
So, for once, let custom perish....
</p>
<p>
Son, 'tis I, your father, ask it,
</p>
<p>
Lift me out and lay me gently
</p>
<p>
On the rock and ... take our basket.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Oh! the young lord's wild amazement
</p>
<p>
As he heard that tiny hum;
</p>
<p>
Turned the lantern light behind him
</p>
<p>
Stricken with amazement dumb.
</p>
<p>
Oh! the young lord's vast confusion
</p>
<p>
As its meaning gave a flicker&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Oh! the mild iconoclastic
</p>
<p>
Staring o'er the edge of wicker.
</p>
<p>
Staring&#8212;staring&#8212;simply staring
</p>
<p>
With his filmy red-rimmed eyes&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Down Hasan his father lifted
</p>
<p>
Silent still in strange surmise.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Never faster had prince ridden
</p>
<p>
From the place of Persian devils,
</p>
<p>
Where its huge and inky bastions
</p>
<p>
Frowned across the golden levels;
</p>
<p>
Nor before had faster travelled
</p>
<p>
Scion of the equine brood
</p>
<p>
Than that day, that day of portent,
</p>
<p>
Galloped she the silver-shoed.
</p>
<p>
Saw Hasan the meaning clearly
</p>
<p>
And a prophet (so they said)
</p>
<p>
After sunset thro' the taverns
</p>
<p>
Loud proclaimed the custom dead.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
This a legend of old Persia

The Roof of the World.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Ere the first blush of morning's rose
</p>
<p>
Had reddened the eternal snows,
</p>
<p>
I plunged the pines among,
</p>
<p>
And came down thro' the forest sons
</p>
<p>
In their deep-ranked battalions
</p>
<p>
With practised steps and strong.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Then heard I from the plateau rock
</p>
<p>
A lowing cow and a crowing cock&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Thin sounds in upper air.
</p>
<p>
And far below at the valley's end
</p>
<p>
I saw the morning smoke ascend
</p>
<p>
That showed me men were there.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Ho! you lads, arouse, arouse!
</p>
<p>
He is descended to your house
</p>
<p>
Of whom wild legend ran.
</p>
<p>
On the roof of the world I dwelt five year,
</p>
<p>
Go, tell your master I am here
</p>
<p>
To be his serving-man.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Ho! all you folk, I climbed above
</p>
<p>
The boundaries of hate and love.
</p>
<p>
Ho! such an one was I&#8212;
</p>
<p>
The wind it whistled to my bone.
</p>
<p>
I was alone, alone, alone
</p>
<p>
With the mountains and the sky.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;It is a timeless land and still;
</p>
<p>
The heavens slowly like a wheel
</p>
<p>
Revolve themselves around;
</p>
<p>
There are two rulers in that place;
</p>
<p>
Eternity sits throned by space;
</p>
<p>
Their law is without sound.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Ho! you folk, such feats I did
</p>
<p>
On the world's roof the snow amid,
</p>
<p>
Ho! such an one as I&#8212;
</p>
<p>
I matched the wild goat in my race,
</p>
<p>
And underneath the long wise face
</p>
<p>
I pulled the beard awry.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Five years I sported undismayed,
</p>
<p>
But suddenly I was afraid,
</p>
<p>
Yea, fearfully amazed.
</p>
<p>
I saw the eye of a dying hare;
</p>
<p>
Infinity was mirrored there
</p>
<p>
Ere it was wholly glazed.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;And this shall be my daily good,
</p>
<p>
To draw your water, hew your wood,
</p>
<p>
And lighten all your need;
</p>
<p>
To do your sowing and your tilling;
</p>
<p>
But to be bright and always willing,
</p>
<p>
And have no other creed.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
All bronzed and bearded was his face;
</p>
<p>
He had a rapture and a grace
</p>
<p>
From living in the wild;
</p>
<p>
As he stared around and strangely spoke
</p>
<p>
He look&#232;d not like other folk,
</p>
<p>
But as an eager child.

The Poet and the Lily.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A poet was born in a modern time,
</p>
<p>
'Neath Saturn and his Rings,
</p>
<p>
He was a child of the world's prime,
</p>
<p>
Knew all beautiful things.
</p>
<p>
He was a child of morning and mirth,
</p>
<p>
Laughing for joy of the sun,
</p>
<p>
His nostrils drank the scent of earth
</p>
<p>
When rain is over and done.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A lily came from the winter's womb
</p>
<p>
And grew in its own sweet pride,
</p>
<p>
But the ruthless steel passed over its bloom,
</p>
<p>
And low in the dust it died.
</p>
<p>
And the poet's heart was filled with pain
</p>
<p>
That a delicate thing and rare
</p>
<p>
Should be reft of the beauty of which it was fain
</p>
<p>
And killed by the cruel share.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
So he sang of the meadows white with lambs,
</p>
<p>
And life all young again,
</p>
<p>
Of the colts which gallop to their dams,
</p>
<p>
Knowing not any rein.
</p>
<p>
He sang of the spring upon the sea,
</p>
<p>
Hedges all white with may,
</p>
<p>
The year in its sweet infancy,
</p>
<p>
This our great world at play.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Of shepherds piping to their flocks
</p>
<p>
Across the fields of thyme,
</p>
<p>
Of sunlit fields above the rocks,
</p>
<p>
Where the small waves lap in rhyme.
</p>
<p>
Of glancing maids and youths their peers,
</p>
<p>
For ever young and free,
</p>
<p>
With faces fair, and in their ears
</p>
<p>
Great music of the sea.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He sang the amber moon a-sail
</p>
<p>
In an even of misty blue,
</p>
<p>
The stars which burn, the stars which pale,
</p>
<p>
The might which holds them true;
</p>
<p>
The comets in another sky
</p>
<p>
Which sweep to an unknown morn.
</p>
<p>
He sang of some vast agony
</p>
<p>
Or ever a world was born.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He sang a song like a twanging bow,
</p>
<p>
His head was full of sound
</p>
<p>
As a dark night when winds are low
</p>
<p>
And a swell comes from the ground.
</p>
<p>
He sang a song like a joyous bird
</p>
<p>
In wooded places and hilly,
</p>
<p>
While in the hearts of those that heard
</p>
<p>
Pity grew like a lily.

<p class="title">
The Tramp.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Forth from the ill-lit tavern door
</p>
<p>
Where he had snoozed and boozed before
</p>
<p>
Stumbled his shambling feet.
</p>
<p>
A candle gave a guttering light,
</p>
<p>
And some one growled a hoarse good-night....
</p>
<p>
The Tramp was in the street.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
His boots were blistered, burst and patched,
</p>
<p>
He had a mildewed hat, which matched
</p>
<p>
His green, unlovely coat.
</p>
<p>
Once, too, he caught his foot and swore,
</p>
<p>
And, tho' the night was warm, he wore
</p>
<p>
A muffler at his throat.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And as he went his two lips moved
</p>
<p>
As if he muttered songs he loved
</p>
<p>
To an old, unquiet tune;
</p>
<p>
And as he went his eyes were glazed,
</p>
<p>
Twice, too, he paused like some one dazed
</p>
<p>
And hiccoughed at the moon.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Thus thro' the empty ways he passed
</p>
<p>
Until he reached the road at last
</p>
<p>
With fields at either hand,
</p>
<p>
And in the heavens bare and bright
</p>
<p>
The moon stood high and shed her light
</p>
<p>
Upon the silent land.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And lo! hard by, a lofty rick,
</p>
<p>
No chance was there of stab or prick,
</p>
<p>
It makes a pleasant bed.
</p>
<p>
And so, within, he burrowed deep,
</p>
<p>
And then upon a fragrant heap
</p>
<p>
He laid his unclean head.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The moon was swallowed by a cloud,
</p>
<p>
A nightingale sang sweet and loud
</p>
<p>
From the middle of a wood;
</p>
<p>
From its small body swelled a strain
</p>
<p>
Which flooded all the listening plain.
</p>
<p>
It trembled as it stood.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Upon his hay the Tramp awoke,
</p>
<p>
The golden fountain never broke,
</p>
<p>
The lovely sobbing strain.
</p>
<p>
The melody of that brown bird
</p>
<p>
Awoke a delicate, prisoned chord
</p>
<p>
Within his sodden brain.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The brain of him who lived remote
</p>
<p>
And dreamed strange things he never wrote
</p>
<p>
But hoarded in his mind.
</p>
<p>
He would not kill the dreams he loved
</p>
<p>
For sake of little things that moved
</p>
<p>
The passions of mankind.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Let the red torches toss and flare,
</p>
<p>
And all the long-stemmed trumpets blare,
</p>
<p>
Let brass beat loud on brass.
</p>
<p>
Let the Kings ride in victory,
</p>
<p>
Low comes the thought amidst the cry,
</p>
<p>
&#34;These visions shall but pass.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
For, like reflections in a mirror,
</p>
<p>
Or empty bubbles on a river,
</p>
<p>
The striving world passed by.
</p>
<p>
What seemed to others worth the winning
</p>
<p>
Thro' strong desire or hate of sinning
</p>
<p>
Brought him no energy.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The thunder muttering on the hills,
</p>
<p>
The song of birds, the babbling rills,
</p>
<p>
The painted flowers and stars,
</p>
<p>
This pageantry of earth did seem
</p>
<p>
The parcel of a timeless dream.
</p>
<p>
He lived beyond the bars.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It was to him a vague mirage
</p>
<p>
Or memory of a storied page
</p>
<p>
With only that appeal;
</p>
<p>
But oftentimes a sound or sight
</p>
<p>
Would bring to him his own delight
</p>
<p>
More subtle than the real.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And with his sense of entity
</p>
<p>
Half lost, he raised a vacant eye
</p>
<p>
Into the empyrean.
</p>
<p>
And as he lay upon his back
</p>
<p>
The pealing centuries rolled back....
</p>
<p>
He saw the blue &#198;gean.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And thus he dreamt: &#34;My palace home
</p>
<p>
With minaret and marble dome
</p>
<p>
Upon the sapphire strait.
</p>
<p>
My garden full of nightingales,
</p>
<p>
One singing as the other fails
</p>
<p>
While evening groweth late.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;And from my watch-tower I behold
</p>
<p>
Beneath a sky of molten gold
</p>
<p>
My argosies return.
</p>
<p>
A homeward wind is in their sails,
</p>
<p>
Freighted are they with costly bales,
</p>
<p>
Vast fires behind them burn.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;I have a room with shining floors
</p>
<p>
And lofty roof and polished doors,
</p>
<p>
Wherein I love to dine
</p>
<p>
With two good friends at left and right,
</p>
<p>
Whose converse is my soul's delight
</p>
<p>
And glads my heart like wine.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Or in my marble portico
</p>
<p>
We sit and watch the summer glow
</p>
<p>
And talk of love and death;
</p>
<p>
And when the amber twilight fails
</p>
<p>
We listen to the nightingales,
</p>
<p>
And evening holds her breath.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Oh! Charicles and Charmides,
</p>
<p>
Much have I dreamt of hours like these,
</p>
<p>
My friends I never knew&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Whose voices and whose grave, sweet words
</p>
<p>
Were lovelier than the songs of birds,
</p>
<p>
And fresher than the dew.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;For Charicles has love and youth,
</p>
<p>
And all his words are sweet with truth,
</p>
<p>
Like a garden with the rain;
</p>
<p>
And Charmides is mild and wise,
</p>
<p>
But with his tear-washed, violet eyes
</p>
<p>
Yet can he smile again.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Perhaps I knew you, ancient lords
</p>
<p>
Of nobler wit and finer chords&#8212;
</p>
<p>
But this I cannot tell;
</p>
<p>
For ever lovely things I sought
</p>
<p>
In some strange borderland of thought,
</p>
<p>
Content therein to dwell.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;For who could blame or who could praise
</p>
<p>
If one should choose to pass his days
</p>
<p>
In a phantasy of dreams,
</p>
<p>
And, finding thus his own ideal
</p>
<p>
In things dissevered from the real,
</p>
<p>
Be happier than he seems?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Ah! who could praise or who could blame,
</p>
<p>
Tho' glimmers all my way the same,
</p>
<p>
Like a dyke-road thro' a fen.
</p>
<p>
Far on, far on&#8212;a ruddy spark&#8212;
</p>
<p>
The toll-light glows adown the dark,
</p>
<p>
And I, like other men,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Must pay my toll and pass beyond,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
I made no vow, I signed no bond,
</p>
<p>
Nor lose my self-esteem,
</p>
<p>
But pass, unknown, unloved, unlost,
</p>
<p>
The man who knew and weighed the cost,
</p>
<p>
The man who dared to dream.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;For what is Fame and what's a Name,
</p>
<p>
Your cries of sorrow, wrath, and shame,
</p>
<p>
Your Hamlets and King Lears,
</p>
<p>
The night must cover them again
</p>
<p>
Did they last a thousand lives of men,
</p>
<p>
A thousand thousand years.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;The world may say that I have missed;
</p>
<p>
Ah! no&#8212;I am an egoist
</p>
<p>
Of subtle, fixed design.
</p>
<p>
My dreams a garden are to me
</p>
<p>
To which no other holds the key,
</p>
<p>
I wish to keep them mine.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;All mine&#8212;those tender, half-thought things,
</p>
<p>
Which flutter gossamer rainbow wings
</p>
<p>
And hover near, near, near.
</p>
<p>
Why should I catch and pin them down
</p>
<p>
And lose their beauty for a crown
</p>
<p>
Would chafe my brows to wear.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;And thus, a baser alchemist
</p>
<p>
In some perverted plan persist
</p>
<p>
To turn my gold to dross.
</p>
<p>
If I turned my gold their soul were sold
</p>
<p>
Tho' I wore a crown and cloth of gold,
</p>
<p>
Their soul were then the loss.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;If I sat high, a crown&#232;d king,
</p>
<p>
With lofty brows in a royal ring,
</p>
<p>
A lustrous diadem,
</p>
<p>
If I wore the titles 'High, Strong, and Wise,'
</p>
<p>
And garments stained with purple dyes,
</p>
<p>
All jewelled at the hem
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;With emeralds, rubies and jacinth stones,
</p>
<p>
Such as great kings wear on their golden thrones,
</p>
<p>
And a royal mantle of vair,
</p>
<p>
And held a sceptre in my hand,
</p>
<p>
Which showed me ruler of all the land,
</p>
<p>
In my palace, where none might dare
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;To cross my word, but all must bow
</p>
<p>
As the courtly throng are bending now,
</p>
<p>
And give the King his meed,
</p>
<p>
And slaves waved forests of peacock fans
</p>
<p>
And a cry went up like a single man's,
</p>
<p>
'This is the King indeed.'
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;For I could be King and Overlord
</p>
<p>
In the wondrous realm of the written word,
</p>
<p>
Am King there ... in my dreams.
</p>
<p>
So, loving dreams, this life I choose&#8212;
</p>
<p>
The tramp's with tattered coat and shoes,
</p>
<p>
Yet happier than it seems.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Thus, oh! my dreams, you grow not old,

No process dims you, leaves you cold,

Immortal, bright, you come,
</p>
<p>
And if you come not, I am wise,

<p>
I have my trusted old allies,

<p>
Tobacco, beer, and rum.&#34;

<p>
His chin sank down upon his breast,
</p>
<p>
And suddenly the brown bird ceased
</p>
<p>
To pour her strain abroad.
</p>
<p>
A sound less sweet to mortal ear
</p>
<p>
Uprose (had one been there to hear)....
</p>

It was the tramp who snored.

Certain it is that of those qualities

We are enamoured which we most do lack.

Bent, broken, bowed, small, apish, humped of back,

Marred in the mint, perfection's contrary,

To sweet perfection found his marred life thrall,

Then, peering keenly from his peat-roofed home,

Calm in his power he scanned her as he chose,

I will wear the palmer's weed

And walk in the sandal shoon.

I will walk in the sun by day

And sleep beneath the moon.

I will set forth as the bells toll

Because of a sin upon my soul

We are the old, old men,

Once fierce and high-hearted in frolics,

But now we are three score and ten

Or upwards&#8212;mere relics

Which time in his spite and unruth

With flower faces and carriage

Now all are withered and grey,

Their beauty has passed away,

We had sooner have never

That are so sick and forlorn;

Swift hunters of meadows.

Now we sit like a circle of stones,

<p>
Ill token.

For our sweetest thoughts were broken

The Island.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Once (was it long ago, dear?
</p>
<p>
Oh! hark to the sighing seas.)
</p>
<p>
We sailed to a wonderful Island
</p>
<p>
In the golden Antipodes,
</p>
<p>
Where the waves wore an azure mantle,
</p>
<p>
The winds were ever at rest,
</p>
<p>
For we'd left the Old World behind us
</p>
<p>
A thousand leagues to the West.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We came to that wonderful Island;
</p>
<p>
Girt by a ring of foam
</p>
<p>
It lay in the sea like a jewel
</p>
<p>
Under an azure dome.
</p>
<p>
The cliffs were all gold in the sunlight,
</p>
<p>
The strand was a floor of gold,
</p>
<p>
So we knew we'd come to the Island
</p>
<p>
We'd read of in tales of old.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Was it long we stayed in our Island?
</p>
<p>
(Dear, I can never say)
</p>
<p>
I know we walked on the mountains
</p>
<p>
Which looked far over the bay.
</p>
<p>
I know that we laughed for pleasure
</p>
<p>
(Were we wise or a couple of fools?)
</p>
<p>
As we gazed at the painted fishes
</p>
<p>
Which swam in the shallow pools.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And night drew over our Island
</p>
<p>
The purple pall of the skies,
</p>
<p>
The air was heavy with fragrance
</p>
<p>
And soft with the breath of sighs,
</p>
<p>
And voices out of the forest,
</p>
<p>
Voices out of the sea,
</p>
<p>
Told the eternal secret....
</p>
<p>
Told it to you and me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And the stars came down from the heavens,
</p>
<p>
And the magical tropic moon,
</p>
<p>
To dance a measure together
</p>
<p>
Over the still lagoon;
</p>
<p>
And the whisper of distant forests,
</p>
<p>
The noise of the surf in our ears,
</p>
<p>
Seemed like the song of the ages
</p>
<p>
Sung by the passing years.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But we said &#34;farewell&#34; to our Island
</p>
<p>
Which we had discovered alone....
</p>
<p>
The sand ... and the palms ... and the headland....
</p>
<p>
The westering wind ... and the sun.
</p>
<p>
We said &#34;farewell&#34; to our Island
</p>
<p>
(Oh! hark to the sullen rain!)
</p>
<p>
... And I knew as it fell behind us
</p>
<p>
We should not see it again.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
For only a few may go there
</p>
<p>
And they but once may go,

<p>
With glamour of stars above them

<p>
And the swinging seas below.
</p>
<p>
But I still hear its forests whisper,
</p>
<p>
The noise of the surf on the shore,
</p>
<p>
In that far-off wonderful Island
</p>
<p>
Which I shall see no more.

Alas! Alas! it has no care,

Become the wind upon the sea

Adeimantus.

<p>
The dream of Adeimantus
</p>
<p>
Who carved for a Grecian Prince
</p>
<p>
Statues of perfect marble,
</p>
<p>
Fairer than all things since,
</p>
<p>
Wonderful, white, and gracious
</p>
<p>
Like lotus flowers on a mere,
</p>
<p>
Or phantoms born of the moonbeam,
</p>
<p>
Beyond all praise but a tear.
</p>
<p>
The dream of Adeimantus
</p>
<p>
(As he lay upon his bed),
</p>
<p>
Wonderful, white, and gracious,
</p>
<p>
And this was the word it said.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Arise! oh! Adeimantus,
</p>
<p>
The breath of the dawn blows chill,
</p>
<p>
The stars begin to fade
</p>
<p>
Ere the first ray strikes the sill.
</p>
<p>
Arise! oh! Adeimantus
</p>
<p>
For here is work to your hand,
</p>
<p>
If the fingers fashion the dream
</p>
<p>
As the soul can understand.&#34;
</p>
<p>
He rose from his troubled bed
</p>
<p>
Ere the dream had faded away,
</p>
<p>
And he said, &#34;I will fashion the dream
</p>
<p>
As the potter fashions the clay.&#34;
</p>
<p>
He said in his great heart's vanity,
</p>
<p>
&#34;I will fashion a wondrous thing
</p>
<p>
To stand in a palace of onyx
</p>
<p>
And blind the eyes of a king.&#34;
</p>
<p>
He said in the pride of his soul
</p>
<p>
As the birds began to sing,
</p>
<p>
&#34;I will surely take no rest
</p>
<p>
Till I fashion this wondrous thing.
</p>
<p>
I will swear an oath to eschew
</p>
<p>
The white wine and the red,
</p>
<p>
To eat no delicate meats
</p>
<p>
Nor break the fair, white bread.
</p>
<p>
I will not walk in the city
</p>
<p>
But labour here alone
</p>
<p>
In the dew and the dusk and the flush
</p>
<p>
Till the vision smiles from the stone.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Six days he wrought at the marble,
</p>
<p>
But cunning had left his hand,
</p>
<p>
And his fingers would not fashion
</p>
<p>
What his soul could understand.
</p>
<p>
Six days he fasted and travailed,
</p>
<p>
Hard was the watch to keep,
</p>
<p>
So the chisel fell from his fingers
</p>
<p>
And he sank with a sob to sleep.
</p>
<p>
But a vision came to his slumber
</p>
<p>
Beautiful as before,
</p>
<p>
Floating in with the moonbeam
</p>
<p>
Gliding over the floor.
</p>
<p>
It floated in with the moonbeam
</p>
<p>
And stood beside his bed,
</p>
<p>
Wonderful, white, and gracious,
</p>
<p>
And this was the word it said.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Courage, oh! Adeimantus,
</p>
<p>
I am the perfect thing
</p>
<p>
To stand in a shrine of jasper
</p>
<p>
And blind the eyes of a king.
</p>
<p>
I am the strange desire,
</p>
<p>
The glory beyond the dream,
</p>
<p>
The passion above the song,
</p>
<p>
The spirit-light of the gleam.
</p>
<p>
I come to my best beloved,
</p>
<p>
Not actual, from afar,
</p>
<p>
Fairer than hope or thought,
</p>
<p>
More beautiful than a star.
</p>
<p>
Courage, oh! Adeimantus,
</p>
<p>
Lay strength and strength to your soul.
</p>
<p>
You shall fashion surely a part
</p>
<p>
Tho' you may not grasp the whole.&#34;

Once ... I seem to remember....

<p>
Crept in the noonday heat
</p>
<p>
A boy with a crooked shadow

Which capered along the street.
</p>
<p>
A boy whose shadow was mocked at
</p>
<p>
By the children passing along,
</p>
<p>
Straight and tall and beautiful,
</p>
<p>
Happy with laughter and song.
</p>
<p>
So, he envied their beauty....
</p>
<p>
He who was crooked and brown....
</p>
<p>
The strong youths of the mountain,
</p>
<p>
The white girls of the town,

Envied their happy meetings
</p>
<p>
And the tender words they spoke
</p>
<p>
In the shadow of the temples,
</p>
<p>
Under the groves of oak.
</p>
<p>
And his lonely heart was stricken
</p>
<p>
That never his lot might be
</p>
<p>
To walk with a maid who loved him....

So quaint and crooked was he.

Who longed for a maiden's smile.
</p>
<p>
Till once on a day in summer
</p>
<p>
My soul was touched with a gleam,
</p>
<p>
And I woke from my morbid fancies

<p>
Like one from an evil dream,
</p>
<p>
And knew that the gods in their wisdom
</p>
<p>
Had made and set me apart.
</p>
<p>
Lean, misshapen, and ugly....
</p>
<p>
No toy for a maiden's heart.
</p>
<p>
And I felt with a heart awakened
</p>
<p>
That leapt in a riot of joy,
</p>
<p>
The heart of a wise man and proud
</p>
<p>
Not the heart of a moody boy.
</p>
<p>
Viewing the old things anew
</p>
<p>
With an inner wonder in each:
</p>
<p>
The cloud ships driven thro' heaven,
</p>
<p>
The sea rolling into the beach,
</p>
<p>
The magic heart of the woodland,
</p>
<p>
The loves of nymph and faun,

The splendour of starlight nights,

Kneeling under a wall

Where a shadow fell on the street,

Eyes and mind intent

In the midst of the noonday heat.

Eyes and mind intent....

And a stranger passed my way,

... The shadow grew and lengthened

As he stopped to watch my play.

He looked at the little horse,

He looked at the winging bird;

And ere I noticed his presence

He touched me and spoke a word:

</p>
<p>
And stayed there a year and a year

<p>
Working under a master

<p>
Who praised me and held me dear,
</p>
<p>
Till at last a day arose
</p>
<p>
When, taking my hand in his own,
</p>
<p>
&#34;You have my knowledge,&#34; he said,
</p>
<p>
&#34;And now you must stand alone.&#34;
</p>
<p>
And tho' I sorrowed to leave him
</p>
<p>
My heart was ready to sing,
</p>
<p>
So first in praise of the gods
</p>
<p>
I made for an offering
</p>
<p>
(Even as does a shepherd
</p>
<p>
His rustic altar of sods)
</p>
<p>
Bright forms larger than human
</p>
<p>
As mortals dream of the gods.
</p>
<p>
Then, in my strange world-worship,
</p>
<p>
The Tritons, Lords of the Sea,
</p>
<p>
The creatures which haunt the woodland,
</p>
<p>
Happy and shy and free,
</p>
<p>
Nymphs and satyrs and fauns
</p>
<p>
Who worship the great god Pan,
</p>
<p>
And lastly the mighty heroes
</p>
<p>
Who fashion the mind of man.

I rose to the heights of passion

And sounded the depths of will,

<p>
Reaching out to the farthest

<p>
Winnowing down to the last,
</p>
<p>
Gazing into the future
</p>
<p>
And diving into the past.
</p>
<p>
Higher and ever higher
</p>
<p>
Like an eagle soared my art

And I praised the most high gods

Who made and set me apart.

And Prince and poet and painter

Travelled to touch my hand,

The minds which had toiled and suffered,

The minds which could understand,

(An evil day it seems)

I thought, &#34;I will fashion a woman

As I have seen in dreams.
</p>
<p>
I, who never loved woman

<p>
That breathed and spoke and moved,
</p>
<p>
Will fashion a noble statue
</p>
<p>
To show what I could have loved;
</p>
<p>
A glorious naked figure
</p>
<p>
Untouched by time or fate,
</p>
<p>
A symbol of all that might be
</p>
<p>
And she shall be my mate.
</p>
<p>
Not mate of my crooked body,
</p>
<p>
Lean, misshapen and brown,
</p>
<p>
(No longer I feared my shadow
</p>
<p>
But walked a prince in the town)

<p>
But mate for my glorious spirit

Winging thro' shimmering heights,

On the viewless pinions of fancy
</p>
<p>
Where none can follow its flights.&#34;

Thus was I moved in spirit

With the nobles of his Court.

In all his kingdom mountainous

</p>
<p>
Our quivering love's excess,
</p>
<p>
Our rose-drenched ecstasy
</p>
<p>
As glimmering waters drawn
</p>
<p>
By the magic of the moon,
</p>
<p>
As the moon itself at dawn
</p>
<p>
Our love shall vanish soon.
</p>
<p>
So swift (my love-pale groom)
</p>
<p>
A white bird wings its flight.
</p>
<p>
Then find you Death's cold room,
</p>
<p>
Darker than darkest night;
</p>
<p>
Then find you that dark door
</p>
<p>
(And find it all men must)
</p>
<p>
And love there nevermore
</p>
<p>
But crumble back to dust,
</p>
<p>
And kiss there nevermore
</p>
<p>
In flower-drenched ecstasy;
</p>
<p>
Too late then to implore,
</p>
<p>
Too cold to hear a cry.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And then towards the shelving beach
</p>
<p>
A cedar shallop drew,
</p>
<p>
With silver prow shaped like a swan
</p>
<p>
And sails of rainbow hue.
</p>
<p>
Swiftly it came with a wake of foam
</p>
<p>
And lying on its side
</p>
<p>
Like an arrow's flight towards the Knight,
</p>
<p>
Tho' none sat there to guide.
</p>
<p>
And in the shallows by the shore
</p>
<p>
It came to rest at last,
</p>
<p>
The cordage slacked and the rainbow sail
</p>
<p>
Flapped idly on the mast.
</p>
<p>
And the Swan-prow with the ruby eyes
</p>
<p>
Opened his silver beak,
</p>
<p>
And with a musical, magic voice
</p>
<p>
He thus began to speak.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Step in, step in, my gallant lad,
</p>
<p>
Your youth shall be my fare.
</p>
<p>
For you my mistress opes her door
</p>
<p>
And combs her wine-dark hair.
</p>
<p>
She swelled my sail with an eager wind
</p>
<p>
And drove me to this beach,
</p>
<p>
She gave strange sight to my ruby eyes
</p>
<p>
And filled my beak with speech.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;She saw you in the magic glass
</p>
<p>
The hour that she has might,
</p>
<p>
As you rode across the purple heath,
</p>
<p>
Honour and armour bright.
</p>
<p>
Step in, step in, my lover bold
</p>
<p>
And come to the West with me
</p>
<p>
Where the young nymphs play in the wave and lift
</p>
<p>
Their white arms from the sea;
</p>
<p>
And the Tritons chase the laughing rout
</p>
<p>
And swim by the vessel's side,
</p>
<p>
Blowing on horns confusedly,
</p>
<p>
Or shouting words of pride.
</p>
<p>
You hear it now, but the time will come
</p>
<p>
When you shall hear no more
</p>
<p>
The ceaseless wash of a dreaming sea,
</p>
<p>
Its ripples on the shore.
</p>
<p>
Oh! follow, follow the sinking sun
</p>
<p>
And the great white Evening Star,
</p>
<p>
A magic wind shall breathe behind
</p>
<p>
Our sail, and bear us far.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He doffed his red-plumed casque of steel,
</p>
<p>
All flaxen was his hair,
</p>
<p>
And he was clad from throat to heel
</p>
<p>
In the armour princes wear,
</p>
<p>
From throat to heel in silver mail
</p>
<p>
Like a shining prince in a fairy-tale.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The witch Hegertha o'er him bent,
</p>
<p>
(Ah! God, her face was fair)
</p>
<p>
Her breath blew on him like a scent,
</p>
<p>
She touched him with her hair.
</p>
<p>
There was no stronger witch than this,
</p>
<p>
And she gave the Knight her first kiss.
</p>
<p>
And he was bound to her sword and hand,
</p>
<p>
To do whatever she might command.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then up to her full height she drew,
</p>
<p>
Down poured her hair like wine,
</p>
<p>
Her pale, proud face looked sadly through
</p>
<p>
&#8212;A moon in a wood of pine&#8212;
</p>
<p>
She breathed a spell in a low, sweet tone
</p>
<p>
Which none of woman born could disown.
</p>
<p>
And he was bound to her side till death
</p>
<p>
By the spell just uttered above her breath.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She drew his soul forth with her eyes,
</p>
<p>
As a drinker slakes his drouth,
</p>
<p>
A little smile played sorrowful, wise,
</p>
<p>
About her rose-red mouth.
</p>
<p>
She stooped down and called his soul forth,
</p>
<p>
And left him naught but his body's earth.
</p>
<p>
And he was bound to her evermore
</p>
<p>
By the soul he lost and the word he swore.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
For evermore and evermore
</p>
<p>
In the chamber by the sea,
</p>
<p>
Till death should break the spell-bound door
</p>
<p>
And end his slavery;
</p>
<p>
In the chamber strewn with flowers in bloom
</p>
<p>
With a heavy scent like death,
</p>
<p>
Echoing ever the song of doom
</p>
<p>
Which the sad sea moaned beneath.
</p>
<p>
For evermore and evermore
</p>
<p>
Till life ceased in his side,
</p>
<p>
Bound to the room and the rose-strewn floor
</p>
<p>
And the strange, unholy bride.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And naught could save him now, when once the spell
</p>
<p>
Had fallen on him, binding limbs and will,
</p>
<p>
Where he sat listening to the sad sea swell,
</p>
<p>
Amid the roses which no time could kill.
</p>
<p>
Naught could restore lost courage to his eyes,
</p>
<p>
The Knightly ardour that he used to feel,
</p>
<p>
Or make his heart the seat of high emprise,
</p>
<p>
Or nerve his hand to grasp the shining steel.
</p>
<p>
Whether she kept him fast by her enchantment,
</p>
<p>
Or drove him forth to roam death-pale and weeping,
</p>
<p>
Naught could remind him what his life's fair grant meant,
</p>
<p>
Now that his soul was in Hegertha's keeping.

The Dreamer.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
This is the dream of the Dreamer
</p>
<p>
With the grave thought-sunken eyes,
</p>
<p>
Which he dreamed between sleeping and waking,
</p>
<p>
Between the night and the making
</p>
<p>
Of dawn ... and he dreamed in this wise:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To the gate of the dawn came a chariot
</p>
<p>
Which four black stallions were drawing,
</p>
<p>
And a spirit charioteer,
</p>
<p>
With the burning eyes of a seer,
</p>
<p>
Held them impatiently pawing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He mounted the floor of the chariot,
</p>
<p>
And the Spirit drew together
</p>
<p>
His reins, his strong grip tight'ning,
</p>
<p>
And his thong flashed out like a lightning,
</p>
<p>
And the horses rushed up to &#230;ther.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The Dreamer was caught into space
</p>
<p>
With a pang as of ending or birth,
</p>
<p>
And lo! clouds builded above him,
</p>
<p>
And beneath him soundless and moving
</p>
<p>
The sea of his own little earth.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
They clove the walls of the clouds,
</p>
<p>
And snorted each coal black stallion
</p>
<p>
Nursed by the Spirit, whose hair
</p>
<p>
Streamed out like a banner, and bare
</p>
<p>
In the night was the moon&#8212;a medallion
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And then an ice-sheathed corpse
</p>
<p>
With ancient glaciers and snouted
</p>
<p>
Craters of fires extinct,
</p>
<p>
Chain on chain of them linked.
</p>
<p>
And the Lord of the Chariot shouted
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And shook out his hissing lash
</p>
<p>
Over the backs of the four
</p>
<p>
Till they whirled up faster and faster,
</p>
<p>
Till the sun became vaster and vaster,
</p>
<p>
And its flames leapt out with a roar
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Of mountains, subsident, resurging,
</p>
<p>
Innumerable, ceaseless of action,
</p>
<p>
Years and years into space....
</p>
<p>
And the Dreamer covered his face,
</p>
<p>
As he rode, in his stupefaction.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
They passed with a dip and a swerve,
</p>
<p>
As a swallow skims the downs,
</p>
<p>
Far up into the height,
</p>
<p>
And the stars looked down from the night
</p>
<p>
Like the lights of distant towns.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Swift is the lonely thought
</p>
<p>
Of a sage, a mountain-dweller,
</p>
<p>
But swifter far was their rush
</p>
<p>
Thro' the awful cold and the hush
</p>
<p>
Of the spaces interstellar.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
They heard the approaching thunder,
</p>
<p>
And saw the glare of a comet
</p>
<p>
Holding its destined way
</p>
<p>
To an undiscovered day,
</p>
<p>
And its tresses streamed out from it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
They broke thro' other systems,
</p>
<p>
By huger alien spheres,
</p>
<p>
Each in its orbit travelling,
</p>
<p>
The timeless skeins unravelling
</p>
<p>
Of a law with no count of years
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And came at last to a planet,
</p>
<p>
Girt in a gleaming ring
</p>
<p>
Of cloud and vapour and mist,
</p>
<p>
Which the light of four moons kissed
</p>
<p>
To a wonderful milk-white thing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then the Spirit reined in his stallions,
</p>
<p>
And pointed in exultation
</p>
<p>
And turned his orb&#232;d eyes,
</p>
<p>
Which burned with a wild surmise
</p>
<p>
And a dreadful penetration,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
On the Dreamer, who followed, and lo!
</p>
<p>
The Heavens had changed their stations,
</p>
<p>
And their voids were with unknown
</p>
<p>
And greater galaxies sown
</p>
<p>
And altered constellations.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And, beyond, a scatter of crystals,
</p>
<p>
And, beyond, bright motes in a beam,
</p>
<p>
And, beyond, while the Spirit probed him
</p>
<p>
To the soul in the flesh that robed him,
</p>
<p>
An uncountable shimmering stream.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He saw these worlds all marshalled,
</p>
<p>
And their ways all governed for ever;
</p>
<p>
And he felt the sight of his soul
</p>
<p>
Shrivel up like a fire-licked scroll
</p>
<p>
In his insupportable terror.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then the Spirit pointed again,
</p>
<p>
And wheeled the might of his horses
</p>
<p>
And shouted ... and down they fell,
</p>
<p>
As a pebble drops in a well,
</p>
<p>
Thro' the worlds and the roar of their courses.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And the Dreamer looked, and behold!
</p>
<p>
In a point to &#230;ons withdrawn....
</p>
<p>
A scarce visible speck of light,
</p>
<p>
His own sun like a mite,
</p>
<p>
And the blur of his own little dawn.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Now the Dreamer, who rode by night
</p>
<p>
In the car of the Spirit thro' space,
</p>
<p>
Came in the blue of June morning,
</p>
<p>
In a mood betwixt pity and scorning,
</p>
<p>
To the populous market-place.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Afar in the infinite blue
</p>
<p>
Hung the snow-capped mountain-ranges;
</p>
<p>
But round him moved the press
</p>
<p>
Of the city's business
</p>
<p>
In kaleidoscopic changes.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
For the square was all life and all colour,
</p>
<p>
All confusion and clamour,
</p>
<p>
As dealers showed the paces
</p>
<p>
Of colts, untamed in the traces,
</p>
<p>
To the rap of the auctioneer's hammer.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He saw there the dusty sheep
</p>
<p>
Trotting blindly amidst the throng;
</p>
<p>
The swine with quivering snouts,
</p>
<p>
The boys who urged them with shouts,
</p>
<p>
The hawkers of picture and song;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The brown-skinned peasants trudging
</p>
<p>
By their slow-paced bullock wains,
</p>
<p>
With children asprawl the load,

And wives who scolded and rode
</p>
<p>
With an eye to their husbands' gains;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The hooknosed Orient merchants,
</p>
<p>
Who came in the caravans

<p>
And bargained over the prices

Of silks and carpets and spices,
</p>
<p>
Pearls and feathers and fans;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The clumsy sailors in ear-rings
</p>
<p>
From the echoing harbour beach,
</p>
<p>
With parrots and shells for their wares,
</p>
<p>
The light of the sun in their stares,
</p>
<p>
The sound of the wind in their speech.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And the shrill-voiced changers of money
</p>
<p>
Who sat with their clerks at the tables....
</p>
<p>
And it seemed to him all no matter

<p>
As he gazed ... like the evening chatter

<p>
Of starlings under his gables.

<div class="stanza">
<p>
And lo! hard by at a pillar

Two learned Sophists disputed,

Taking the turn of speech

</p>
<p>
Or else each other confuted

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
With babble and clenching of fist,

The grave-eyed Dreamer watched them

<p>
Shouting and seething and ranting.

<p>
But, when they perceived him, panting
</p>
<p>
(For a sudden impulse snatched them)
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Ran up a crowd of both factions

No man and his need. Therefore lend us

<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Thy wisdom in this our dilemma.&#34;

And the Dreamer answered, &#34;I hear.&#34;

So they told him with quibble and chatter....

Like the croaking of frogs in a mere.

<p>
And behold! there ran thro' the market,

<p>
Hard by where the Dreamer stood,

<p>
A natural, void of desire

Save for warmth of the sun or of fire
</p>
<p>
Or for softness abed or food.

</div>
<div class="stanza">

Naught held he dearer in mind,

Save the sound of the thunder deep-voiced

<p>
Or the seas climbing into the harbour;

<p>
Happy and careless and free

<p>
Was a boy who would ne'er be a man)

<div class="stanza">
<p>
Munching the gift of a cake,

A pilfered apple or fig,

Smiling a secret smile,

With a timid foot and eye,

As a young horse comes in a meadow.

The Parting of Lancelot and Guinevere.

<p>
&#34;Be as be may,&#34; said Lancelot,
</p>
<p>
&#34;I go upon my quest.&#34;
</p>
<p>
So mounted he and rode alone
</p>
<p>
Eight days into the West.
</p>
<p>
And to a nunnery came at last
</p>
<p>
Hard by a forest ride,
</p>
<p>
And walking in the cloister-shades
</p>
<p>
Was by the Queen espied.
</p>
<p>
And, when she saw him, swooned she thrice
</p>
<p>
And said, when speak she might,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Ye marvel why I make this fare?
</p>
<p>
'Tis truly for the sight

<p>
Of yonder knight that standeth there,

<p>
And so must ever be;
</p>
<p>
Wherefore I pray you swiftly go

<p>
And call him unto me.&#34;

And to them all said Guinevere

<p>
When Lancelot was brought

<p>
&#34;Fair ladies, thro' this man and me
</p>
<p>
Hath all this war been wrought,
</p>
<p>
And death of the most noblest knights
</p>
<p>
Of whom we have record.
</p>
<p>
And thro' the love we loved is slain
</p>
<p>
My own most noble lord.
</p>
<p>
Wherefor, Sir Lancelot, wit thou well,
</p>
<p>
As thou dost wish my weal,
</p>
<p>
That I am set in such a plight
</p>
<p>
To get my dear soul heal.
</p>
<p>
For sinners were the Saints in Heaven
</p>
<p>
And trust I in God's grace
</p>
<p>
To sit that day at Christ's right hand
</p>
<p>
And see His Bless&#232;d Face.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I heartily require
</p>
<p>
And do beseech thee sore
</p>
<p>
For all the love betwixt us was
</p>
<p>
To see my face no more.
</p>
<p>
But bid thee now, on God's behalf,
</p>
<p>
That thou my side forsake,
</p>
<p>
And to thy kingdom turn again,
</p>
<p>
And keep thy realm from wrake.
</p>
<p>
My heart, as well it loved thee once,
</p>
<p>
Serveth me not arights
</p>
<p>
To see thee, sithen is destroyed
</p>

The flower of kings and knights.
</p>
<p>
Therefore now get thee to thy realm
</p>
<p>
And take to thee a wife
</p>
<p>
And live with her in joy and bliss,
</p>
<p>
And pray God mend my life.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Nay, Madam,&#34; said Sir Lancelot,
</p>
<p>
&#34;That shall I never do,
</p>
<p>
For I should never be so false
</p>
<p>
Of that I promised you.
</p>
<p>
But unto the same destiny
</p>
<p>
As you I will me take,
</p>
<p>
And cast me specially to pray
</p>
<p>
For you, for Jesu's sake.
</p>
<p>
In you I take record of God,
</p>
<p>
Mine earthly joy I found,
</p>
<p>
And had you willed had taken you
</p>
<p>
To dwell on mine own ground.
</p>
<p>
But sithen you are thus disposed
</p>
<p>
And will the world forsake,
</p>
<p>
Be now ensured that I likewise
</p>
<p>
To penance will me take,
</p>
<p>
And so, if haply I may find
</p>
<p>
A hermit white or grey
</p>
<p>
Who shall receive and shrive me clean,
</p>
<p>
While lasteth life will pray.
</p>
<p>
Wherefore I pray you kiss me now,
</p>
<p>
And never then no mo.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Nay,&#34; said the Queen, &#34;Oh! get thee gone,
</p>
<p>
That can I never do.&#34;
</p>
<p>
So parted they with wondrous dole
</p>
<p>
And swooned for their great teen
</p>
<p>
And to her chamber scarce on live
</p>
<p>
Her ladies bare the Queen.
</p>
<p>
But Lancelot woke at last and went
</p>
<p>
And took his horse from keeping,
</p>
<p>
And all that day and all that night
</p>
<p>
Rode thro' a forest weeping.

The Hermit and the Faun.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A hermit knelt before his door
</p>
<p>
Long-bearded, bald of head,
</p>
<p>
When a laughing faun peeped thro' the brake
</p>
<p>
And these the words he said,
</p>
<p>
&#34;My mother was a water-nymph
</p>
<p>
And in these woods I grew,
</p>
<p>
The faun, Amyntas, is my name,
</p>
<p>
To what name answer you?
</p>
<p>
How came you to this lonely hut,
</p>
<p>
Why kneel you in the dust,
</p>
<p>
With scalp as bald as a beggar's bowl
</p>
<p>
And beard as red as rust?
</p>
<p>
Why make you with those knotted claws
</p>
<p>
Your gestures strange and sad?
</p>
<p>
The sheep-bells tinkle from the plain,
</p>
<p>
The forest paths are glad.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Oh! creature of the wood and wild
</p>
<p>
You may not know my name,
</p>
<p>
It was forgotten long ago
</p>
<p>
For it was one of shame.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I made a vow to dwell
</p>
<p>
Upon this forest brink
</p>
<p>
And take the ripened nuts for food
</p>
<p>
And catch the rain for drink,
</p>
<p>
To scrape wild honey from the rocks
</p>
<p>
And make my bed on leaves
</p>
<p>
Because of the hot sins of my youth
</p>
<p>
Whereat my spirit grieves.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Not such as you, Oh! ancient man,
</p>
<p>
Our joyous Satyrs here:
</p>
<p>
Old men are they all laughter-mad
</p>
<p>
Who wallow in good cheer.
</p>
<p>
Amid lush grasses soft and cool
</p>
<p>
They make their feasting ground,
</p>
<p>
With smilax and with bryony
</p>
<p>
Their rosy pates are crowned.
</p>
<p>
You see them thro' the forest trunks
</p>
<p>
Great rolling gladsome shapes,
</p>
<p>
Who prop themselves on skins of wine
</p>
<p>
By purple piles of grapes.
</p>
<p>
Their huge brown bellies quake with mirth,
</p>
<p>
Their ancient eyes are bright,
</p>
<p>
And there they sit and roar old tales
</p>
<p>
Far, far into the night.
</p>
<p>
Then tipsy with the heady juice
</p>
<p>
Each falls into a heap,
</p>
<p>
Till white-horned morning bids him wake
</p>
<p>
With all the land from sleep.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Oft lying in this lonely hut
</p>
<p>
On panting summer nights
</p>
<p>
I watched the stars like silver lamps
</p>
<p>
Hung from those purple heights,
</p>
<p>
And heard the forest-depths behind
</p>
<p>
Fill with disquieting noise
</p>
<p>
Like frightened cries of flying girls
</p>
<p>
And shouts of eager boys,
</p>
<p>
And saw white shapes go flitting past
</p>
<p>
Like runners in a race
</p>
<p>
And caught faint murmurs, sighs and laughs
</p>
<p>
From all the forest place.
</p>
<p>
And oft a distant sound of shouts
</p>
<p>
Came with the soft night airs,
</p>
<p>
And I ... lest evil might befall
</p>
<p>
Got swiftly to my prayers.&#34;

<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;And tell me now, Oh! ancient man,
</p>
<p>
The God to whom you pray,
</p>
<p>
These woods know none but mighty Pan
</p>
<p>
Whom all our folk obey.
</p>
<p>
His altar stands by yonder plane
</p>
<p>
And there the shepherds bring,
</p>
<p>
Toiling up from the fields below,
</p>
<p>
Each day an offering,
</p>
<p>
A lamb or else a yearling kid,
</p>
<p>
A bud-horned lusty fellow,
</p>
<p>
Great cheeses, grapes, or bursting figs,
</p>
<p>
Or apples red and yellow,
</p>
<p>
Or melons ripened in the sun
</p>
<p>
A foot from end to end.
</p>
<p>
Such gifts the shepherds bring to Pan
</p>
<p>
That he may be their friend.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;He is our Father, Lord of all,
</p>
<p>
From the meadow to the Pass,

<p>
Or green snake in the grass?&#34;

<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Rash Thing, beware,&#34; the Hermit cried,
</p>
<p>
Like agates were his eyes,
</p>
<p>
&#34;The God I serve you do not know
</p>
<p>
A strong God, just and wise.
</p>
<p>
For He will purge your streams and woods,
</p>
<p>
And smite both hip and thigh

<p>
Your Satyrs, amorous bestial sots,
</p>
<p>
Your careless company

Who wanton in the thymy ways
</p>
<p>
In which these woods abound,
</p>
<p>
And kiss with soft empurpled mouths,
</p>
<p>
Luxuriantly crowned.
</p>
<p>
My soul is filled with prophecy;
</p>
<p>
Dimly I see a bark
</p>
<p>
Which runs by some low wooded isle;
</p>
<p>
The night is warm and dark,
</p>
<p>
And from a promontory rings
</p>
<p>
A sudden bitter cry,
</p>
<p>
It smites the lonely helmsman's ears
</p>
<p>
And tingles in the sky.
</p>
<p>
'Oh! Traveller, tell in every land
</p>
<p>
These tidings strange and dread,

Let all the peoples wail and weep,

<p>
For Pan, great Pan, is dead.'&#34;

Amyntas pursed his pouting lips

<p>
I like you not,&#34; he said.
</p>

&#34;Your flesh is dried, your ribs are lean,
</p>
<p>
You are too lank and sere,
</p>
<p>
Your voice is harsh, your words are grim

<p>
And do not please mine ear.

The great god Pan is all I need

He joined his gay companions

June and November.

<p>
On a day, long ago, I was just a child,
</p>
<p>
I walked with my lover, my arm in his arm,
</p>
<p>
Half of me was sad and half with joy was wild,
</p>
<p>
The wind was so soft and the sun was so warm.
</p>
<p>
I walked with my lover to his pretty nonsense listening,
</p>
<p>
And I pressed my beating heart against my lover's side;
</p>
<p>
And tho' my voice was steady my traitor eyes were glistening,
</p>
<p>
I showed to my lover all I wished to hide.
</p>
<p>
His vows were so tender, his speech was so fluent,
</p>
<p>
He whispered his sorrow if ever we must part.
</p>
<p>
My heart in my bosom fluttered and played truant,
</p>
<p>
So I gave it him all ... my innocent heart.
</p>
<p>
On a green bank amidst the purple irises,
</p>
<p>
And the shadow of a pine-wood across it was flung,
</p>
<p>
I gave him soft words, I gave him my kisses,
</p>
<p>
I gave him myself&#8212;myself that was so young.
</p>
<p>
On a day, long ago, (pity to remember
</p>
<p>
How the wind was soft, how the sun was warm,)&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Then it was June and now it is November,

Then I knew no evil nor thought of any harm.

A Foolish Tragedy.

In the capital of Valladolid

There lived a highborn maiden

<p>
In a white house in a steep street

<p>
With green doors and shutters,
</p>
<p>
Her lips were like scarlet poppies
</p>
<p>
And her hair like a black waterfall,
</p>
<p>
And behind her ear she wore
</p>
<p>
A flower of red geranium.

She is the most wonderful and beautiful thing

In the capital of Valladolid

That their eyes met at a crossing

</p>
<p>
By the greed of a bought duenna
</p>
<p>
And the interchange of love-notes
</p>
<p>
And the help of a hempen ladder
</p>
<p>
They arranged a meeting at midnight.

</div>

<p>
Her father, the rich old Councillor,
</p>

Looked out of a second-floor window

And passed his sword thro' the body

Of one who climbed up a ladder.
</p>
<p>
His fingers loosed the rungs
</p>
<p>
And down he crashed to the pavement.

And out of his handsome body

<p>
His startled spirit departed.
